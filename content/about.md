### About Me

Hi. My name is Jorge. I currently serve as Head of Machine Learning at [Yape](https://www.yape.com.pe), a super app with 15+ million users driving financial inclusion in Peru. My team designs, builds and deploys AI/ML systems that power personalization, experimentation and search at Yape.

Previously, I led [Unravel Carbon](https://www.unravelcarbon.com)'s engineering and data teams in building an AI-powered decarbonization platform used by enterprises to reduce, report and offset their carbon emissions. Before that, I led [Drop](https://www.joindrop.com)'s engineering and data teams after they acquired Canopy Labs, a company I co-founded backed by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where I served as CTO. 

In what now seems like a lifetime ago, I completed a PhD in theoretical physics, doing research in integrability in gauge and string theories at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.pitp.ca/) and the [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca/).

I'm originally from Peru and hold dual Canadian and Peruvian citizenship. After spending my adult life studying, working and living abroad, I relocated back to Lima in 2023 with my wife and two kids. I enjoy practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu and having a good espresso.
