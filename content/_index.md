I'm a technology leader and entrepreneur. I currently work at [Yape](https://www.yape.com.pe), a super app with 17+ million users driving financial inclusion in Peru, where I lead the Machine Learning Engineering and MLOps teams. I previously led engineering and data at [Unravel Carbon](https://www.unravelcarbon.com/) and [Drop](https://www.joindrop.com), and co-founded and served as CTO of Canopy Labs (acquired by Drop).

I'm an alumnus of [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.pitp.ca/) and the [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca/).
